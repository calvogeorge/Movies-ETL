# Movies-ETL.

## Scope of project

This repo is meant for learning, practice and application of Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Postgre in application of the ETL process. In this exercise we used regular expression to clean data acquired via a json file and several csv files.

Using python we were able to work with csv files that would be too large to work in ms excel.
